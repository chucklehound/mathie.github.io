  Sorry, I've been mucking around again. I've restarted this blog
  because I got tired of porting the old content around, most of
  which was out of date nonsense now anyway. The old blog is still on GitHub:
  <a href="https://github.com/mathie/mathie.github.io/tree/old.woss.name">mathie/mathie.github.io#old.woss.name</a>
  so the content is still around. Just take the URL that Google drew you to
  and take a look at the corresponding article in the `_posts` folder.
</p>

<p>
  If there's something on the old blog that's still useful and
  pertinent, please do
  <a href="mailto:mathie@woss.name?subject=Bring%20back%20old%20articles">get in touch</a>
  and I'll republish it here.
</p>

<p>
  Meantime, I'd be delighted if you stuck around and checked out
  the <a href="/">latest article</a> to see if my writing is still
  up to scratch.
</p>
