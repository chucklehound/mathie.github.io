I recently read [Counselling For Toads][], an introduction to
[Transactional Analysis][] set in the world of [Wind in the Willows][]. Toad
(of Toad Hall) is depressed, and his friends are worried about him. They
encourage him to seek help in the form of some counselling, to better
understand his feelings, and to learn to cope with them. The story is of Toad's
adventures in counselling, learning about himself, and figuring out his
relationships with his friends.

It's a lovely story, and a great introduction to Transactional Analysis (TA), a
style of psychotherapy developed by [Eric Berne][]. I'll let you into the good
news before you worry too much about poor old Toad: he makes a full recovery,
and develops a new vigour for life. TA is very much of the opinion that all
emotional difficulties are curable.

There are a few key aspects to TA. These are models used to describe various aspects of people's personalities, their emotional state, and their communication with others. These are:

* How people are structured psychologically, modelled at the Parent, Adult and
  Child ego states.

* Our life positions, which govern how we feel about ourselves (I'm (not) OK)
  in relation to other people (You're (not) OK).

* A way of analysing how people communicate with each other. Transactions
  represent a communication, including not only the words said, but the
  psychological meanings implied (or inferred), too. A 'stroke' is an
  individual unit of communication in this transaction. A 'game' is a
  particular, well known, transaction which has a particular set of rules that
  are followed through the communication.

* Our "Life Script", which is written at an early age, and defines our core
  beliefs. As an adult, our life script passes out of direct awareness, but it
  still drives what be believe and how we act.
