title: A fresh start
---
I've been blogging in one form or another for a few years now. (I recently
unearthed a subversion repository -- converted from CVS with `cvs2svn` -- which
has content from 2002.) But it seems that, perhaps coincidentally, with the
advent of Twitter, it's tailed off. No matter how many times I keeping
'rebooting' the blog, it keeps dwindling back into the back of my mind.

But I've been really enjoying writing lately. I've been *reasonably* good at
keeping up with my morning pages. I've even taken to hand writing them. (I'd
highly recommend it. If your handwriting has atrophied like mine has, then the
constraint on your pace really allows the mind to get in on it.)

The thing that stops me blogging? Fear. I think I'm not good enough to write
stuff and publish it on the world wide web. The stuff that I'd write is wrong,
useless, or just plain obvious. People will judge me and realise that I'm
worthless because of the rambling nonsense I write.

Or worse. Even worse still, people will just ignore me. Publish and they will
come? *refreshes Google Analytics* Two hits? Looking at the location data, one
was me and one was my mum. (Because she's genetically obliged to care.) Yeah,
I'm so unimportant, I'm not even being ridiculed for this rambling nonsense I
write.

These are (two of) the gremlins I live with. They're curious creatures, because
they're not rational and, most of the time, they're not conscious (they live in
that reptilian brain, way below the bits that understand speech and rational
thought). And they're difficult to spot. Sometimes, if they're being
particularly pernicious, it's


{% highlight ruby %}
def hello(planet = 'world')
  puts "Hello, #{planet}!"
end
{% endhighlight %}

That's some code.

This is **bold**, *emphasised*, _underlined_ and `inline code`. Looking OK?
