In pursuit of a juicy lead, he makes his way to a small suburban town only to find that it has become overrun by zombies. He escapes to the local shopping mall, thinking it will be a bastion of safety yet it turns out to be anything but. It will be a true struggle to survive the endless stream of enemies, but players will have full reign of a realistic shopping center, utilizing anything they find to fight off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic. Dead Rising features an open level of freedom and offers a vast array of game play possibilities. As part of a real time system, time is dynamic in Dead Rising, marching on whether Frank is actively engaged or if simply stationary. Time also plays a role as zombies become more powerful when the sun goes down. Though they move slowly during the day, the zombies become stronger and faster at night, making it even more dangerous for players to survive. The unprecedented numbers of enemies come in never-ending waves and consist of a diverse population of former humans that have retained some memory of their previous lives, which is reflected in their behavior and appearance. The variety of different stores in the mall offers players an endless supply of resources including vehicles, makeshift weapons and more. Players will also encounter other survivors along the way and by helping them can acquire valuable clues as to what has happened.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Lost Planet: Extreme Condition</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/374657D7-1FA3-4C33-86D8-CC6F186D29E1-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Capcom</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Great Games and Accessories for the Xbox 360 from Gamesbuyer.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Beatles Rock Band</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/53EF1CD8-71A3-4E7E-81BD-F4E4CF3B4B70-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Electronic Arts</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Beatles - Rock Band</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/48C9FB6B-4A49-49CA-8C77-9525CDB46E70-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Electronic Arts</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">godd condition.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Mass Effect 2</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/8B02D6C6-12DD-47FB-B9E7-54A3D087C820-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Electronic Arts</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">The sci-fi role-playing epic continues, as the Mass Effect story delves into darker territory and the fate of Commander Shepard, his crew and the entire galaxy.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Portal 2</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/69F9A56E-A453-400E-BE26-5AFB65C00A8F-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Electronic Arts</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description"></span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Blue Dragon</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/0095F590-9CB5-4A6C-A04A-B224C8D6A719-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Microsoft</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">game producer Hironobu Sakaguchi of Mistwalker game studio and developer Artoon present the highly anticipated Xbox 360-exclusive Blue Dragon.

Using a third person, over the shoulder, view rather than the usual first person viewpoint the game emphasis the importance of cover and tactics rather than just running and gunning.

For his cousin, Roman, it is the vision that together they can find fortune in Liberty City, gateway to the land of opportunity. As they slip into debt and are dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don’t.<br /><br />Beginning with the 1997 release of the original Grand Theft Auto, the GTA series has been one of the most prolific, controversial and down right entertaining franchises in video games history. This pedigree of success guarantees that the highly anticipated eleventh game in the series, Grand Theft Auto IV, will garner at least as much attention if not more.<br /><br />Return to Liberty City.<br />The dream as Niko expected it.<br />View larger.<br />There's always a catch.<br />View larger.<br />But some skills are international.<br />View larger.<br /><br />The Plot<br />Grand Theft Auto IV is a brand new adventure in the GTA universe following the experiences of Nikolai "Niko" Bellic, a new immigrant from an undisclosed eastern European country whose troubled pa st and the persuasion of his cousin Roman have brought him to the fictional Liberty City. Unfortunately, Niko’s search for the American Dream and a much needed fresh start, hits an immediate snag when the rags to riches story Roman spun to pique Niko's interest is exposed as not only a complete fabrication, but a ploy to enlist Niko’s well-known skills as a tough guy against the ample list of enemies clamouring for Roman’s debt-ridden blood.<br /><br />Because Roman is the only person Niko knows in Liberty City he begrudgingly accepts his role as Roman’s protector despite the deception. But as time goes on Niko comes into his own, and his experience on the wrong side of the tracks proves more valuable than he could have ever imagined as he fights for survival and later supremacy on the crime ridden streets of Liberty City.<br /><br />Game Environments<br />Based on several of the boroughs of New York City and parts of New Jersey, Liberty City, familiar to players of previous games in the series, has been entirely redesigned for GTA IV. Players can expect visible detail down to the weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk, cars and buildings of visibly different ages and a much greater level if verticality in the buildings and bridges that they are able to explore as Niko moves through the city streets. In addition, pedestrians in GTA IV are much more realistic. No longer simply moving cardboard cut-outs, these NPCs are intelligent, modern, human representations that laugh, cry, eat, drink, use cell phones and ATMs, and talking amongst themselves regardless of Niko’s interaction with them.<br /><br />Gameplay<br />Historically GTA games have focused heavily on mission-based play, requiring successful completion of fixed tasks in order for players to progress through the game, but this has changed to a great extent in GTA IV. Players will experience an entirely new and exciting emphasis centred on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting not only in an increased sense of realism, but more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.<br /><br />Features<br />Aside from the car jacking and a detailed city environment here are the new features for GTA IV: Improved combat system - Now you can use cover and also a target lock system, which allows you to take out targets with greater ease and accuracy. Plus, you can engage in some hand-to-hand combat if you can't get your hands on a piece quick enough.Cell phone - Not just for basic phone calls anymore. Use your in-game cell phone to receive missions via SMS, snap photos, and ZiT (tag) songs that can be downloaded exclusively on Amazon.com/mp3.Free time - In between missions you can take advantage of "me" time. There are gentleman's clubs, comedy clubs, bowling alleys, and bars, which all house unique activities.Take a break from the storyline - A variety of side missions allow you to help run a car service, "borrow" cop cars, assassinate targets, help solve problems for those on the street, or take to the air with stunt jumps that are scattered all over the city.Control your own fate - Throughout the game choice moments will arrive causing you to make a decision that will affect relationships and money.<br /><br />Multiplayer<br />Give Niko a rest and create your own multiplayer "hero." GTA has added multiplayer modes allowing you to take your creation out to play online in competitive, co-op, and free form modes. Competitive mode has you fighting against the cops, jacking cars, or racing to finish odd jobs. Co-op challenges you and your friends with various tasks including Hangman's NOOSE where you are responsible for escorting a wanted kingpin to a safe extraction point. Freeform lets you and 15 others lose on Liberty City. Use this mode to hit up the bar and play virtual darts versus each other or head out to the streets and set up your own drag races. If you can dream it, you can do it in Freeform mode.<br /><br />First Episode of Downloadable Content for Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned.

As in the original game, BioShock 2 features a blend of fast-paced action, exploration and puzzle-solving as players follow varying paths through the overarching storyline based on the decisions that they are forced to make at various points in the game. In addition to a further fleshing out of the franchise's popular storyline, players can look forward to new characters, game mechanics, weapons, locations and a series first, multiplayer game options.<br /><br />Set approximately 10 years after the events of the original BioShock, the halls of Rapture once again echo with sins of the past. Along the Atlantic coastline, a monster — somehow familiar, yet still quite different from anything ever seen — has been snatching little girls and bringing them back to the undersea city. It is a Big Sister, new denizens of Rapture who were once one of the forgotten little girls known as Little Sisters, known to inhabit the city's dank halls. No longer a pawn used to harvest ADAM, the dangerously powerful gene-altering lifeblood of Rapture, from the bodies of others and in turn run the risk of being harvested herself, the Big Sister is now the fastest and most powerful thing in Rapture. You, on the other hand are the very first Big Daddy, in fact the prototype, that for some reason has reactivated. You are similar to the Big Daddies familiar from the original BioShock, but also very different in that you possess free will and no memory of the events of the past ten years. The question is, as you travel through the decrepit and beautiful fallen city beneath the waves, hunting for answers and the solution to your own survival, are you really the hunter, or the hunted?<br /><br />  Evolution of the Genetically Enhanced</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">BioShock Infinite</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/E0110016-A6DA-419E-8D64-6C0AC89B824B-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Take 2 Interactive</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description"></span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/5BB9BF5B-ABC4-4CE0-8647-0EAEA375EF5F-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Take 2 Interactive</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">In a nutshell:<br />One of the most respected Western role-playing games of all time is back with huge improvements in graphics and accessibility, including a completely real-time combat system and the largest, most detailed game world ever seen. Phew.<br /><br />The lowdown:<br />Although previous Elder Scrolls games have enjoyed something of a like it or loathe it reputation, this latest sequel has the means to appeal to everyone thanks to one simple improvement: its incredible new graphics. Unlike many role-playing games it is viewed from a first person perspective, with a game world portrayed in a staggering amount of detail, and realistic psychics and characters that genuinely seem to be going on about their own separate lives. The game’s real appeal though lies in the huge freedom: play it exactly how you want.<br /><br />Most exciting moment:<br />Using the new combat engine to fight off dozens of enemies, then stealing one of their mounts and riding off into the sunset.<br /><br />Since you ask:<br />Emperor Uriel Septim VII is voiced by Star Trek and X-Men luminary Patrick Stewart, but all the characters in the game have full spoken voiceovers instead of just onscreen text. This is the next generation, you know.<br /><br />The bottom line:<br />One of the most realistic and accessible role-playing games ever made.<br />Harrison Dent</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Half-Life 2: The Orange Box</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/89A9D2FE-C965-4693-A326-A3FB60F2DC1B-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Valve</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">5 Games, One Box: The Orange Box is the ultimate collection of innovative action games for the PC or console, and an amazing introduction to the Half Life series for console gamers.</span></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">LEGO Rock Band - Game Only</div><div class="cover" onclick="showDetails(this, event)"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/A3B22636-981F-4087-B036-23A194A7E708-140.png" width="99" height="140" /></div><span class="creator">Warner Bros.
