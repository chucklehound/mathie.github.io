# Notes from a Messy Desk

This is yet another scorched earth attempt at a blog called Notes from a Messy
Desk. This time I'm aiming to figure out how to get SCSS and Coffeescript
working with Jekyll, along with a simple article layout. Something a little
less complicated. But then something a little complicated enough to include
tags for relating articles. The idea is that I'll start shifting across and
redrafting articles that I've already written to their new home.
