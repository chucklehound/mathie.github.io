# Notes from a Messy Desk

This is the latest reboot of my blog, Notes from a Messy Desk. There have been
many incarnations of my blog, and several have tried to carry over the previous
versions. This time I've decided to start afresh - at best the old content was
a bit dusty; at worst, it was downright misleading. Time for a fresh start.

You can find the new blog at <http://woss.name/> and it reflects the
[master](https://github.com/mathie/mathie.github.io/tree/master) branch.

## Bootstrap configuration

The CSS is currently a customised version of
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), from the Bootstrap website. To remind
myself, I deselected *all* the components (toggled off all the LESS files, and
all the jQuery plugins), then added:

* Common CSS: typography, code, grid system, forms and buttons.

* Components: Jumbotron, Thumbnails, Wells

* Utilities: Responsive utilities.

I haven't customised any of the LESS variables, since I figured it would be
tricky to keep track of the changes. Now that I'm keeping track of changes
here, that should be simpler. :)
