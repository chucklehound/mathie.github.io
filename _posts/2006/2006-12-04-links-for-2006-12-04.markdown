* [Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords -- Walkthrough](http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox/file/star_wars_kotor_ii_a.txt): Nice, detailed walkthrough of KOTOR II, for assisting in those tricky moments when you accidentally get a DSP and want to redeem yourself.  Uh, yeah, that's it.
* [spod.cx: Solaris 10 / Nevada on Parallels desktop](http://spod.cx/blog/solaris_on_parallels.shtml): Aha, that's how to get Solaris Express (Nevada b50) to install on Parallels.  Now it works nicely. :)
* [Martian LifeBoat](http://www.martian.com/LifeBoat.html): New backup software for Mac OS X -- the USP being that it seems to automatically do backups when the appropriate media is around.  Must try it out some time.
