* [Ruby on Rails Plugins - Agile Web Development](http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins): Ruby on Rails Plugin directory.
* [Test-First Development :: PeepCode Ruby on Rails Screencasts](http://www.peepcode.com/articles/2006/11/26/test-first-development): A new screencast from Topfunky on Test- (or Behaviour-) Driven Development with Rails.  Hopefully there shouldn't be much new content here for me, but I guarantee I pick up something interesting.
* [Rubyist - Acts As State Machine](http://lunchroom.lunchboxsoftware.com/articles/2006/01/21/acts-as-state-machine): A plugin for Ruby on Rails to implement a state machine on Rails models.  Looks like it could be useful for modelling workflow.
* [ONLamp.com -- Introducing Slony](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/11/18/slony.html): An overview of Slony, a replication system for PostgreSQL.  Worth investigating more to see if we can make it do automatic failover.
* [Livejournal's evolving server architecture](http://www.danga.com/words/2004_mysqlcon/mysql-slides.pdf): Livejournal's server architecture and how it's changed to scale over time.  In particular, the idea of Master-Master clusters (slide 25 &amp; 26) sounds interesting.
