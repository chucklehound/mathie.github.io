What a strange, quirky, funny creature. He's the spitting image of Jack Black,
highly entertaining and obviously a gifted programmer. He showed us some neat
tricks with Ruby, like creative use of the splat (`*`) operator. One
particularly nice one was for doing regexps:

    m, *sub = *str.match /regexp/
    if m
      ## sub contains all of your matches
    end

I like that.

He also talked about his sandbox implementation, and how it can be used to run
multiple rails applications inside a single mongrel instance. I got to
thinking that this might be useful for merging third-party apps together into
a single cohesive web site. The most exciting thing? It sounds like sandbox
will be in the next Ruby 1.8.x release!
