*sigh* From the [SpamCop listing of mailbigip.dreamhost.com](http://www.spamcop.net/w3m?action=blcheck&ip=208.97.132.5):

That appears to be the outgoing mail host for [DH](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?wossname) if I use SMTP AUTH.  Which I do, because I regularly connect from my laptop using different ISPs, so it's the most flexible solution.  And, unfortunately, a few customers I communicate with are stuck with [an ISP](http://www.lumison.net/) that outright rejects any mail from a host listed in SpamCop.  I'm not in the Mail Hosting/ISP world much these days, but I thought that sort of thing had gone out of fashion?

Still, it does mean that, in the last 51 days, I've had less than 86% availablility of email for communicating with them.  That kinda really sucks.  I'm off to go grump at both ISPs because they're both doing something dumb.
