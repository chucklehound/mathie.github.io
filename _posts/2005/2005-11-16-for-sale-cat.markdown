<p><a href="http://woss.name/wp-content/Benjy.jpg"><img src='http://woss.name/wp-content/thumb-Benjy.jpg' alt='Benjy being deceptively cute' class="alignright" /></a> For sale, one cat.  Ginger tom, about 5 years old.  Very loving, purry, squeaky, affectionate creature.  Answers to the names <em>Benjy</em>, <em>Scrotbags</em>, <em>Quit It!</em> and <em>shut up, it's 5 o'clock in the bloody morning!</em></p>

Yes, Benjy's been doing his trademark move again this morning:  at some ridiculous time in the morning, he starts running around the flat, squeaking and miaowing at the top of his voice, pouncing on the bed and generally not letting anything else in the flat sleep (me, Annabel or even Jess).  Last night we tried closing the bedroom door, to keep him out, but you'd be amazed at the amount of noise he can make with a closed door...  Eventually, I resorted to getting up (at about 06:00) and shutting the pair of them into the kitchen so at least Annabel could get some more sleep.  I'd given up by this point.
