Annabel figured out the ideal way to deal with a really crappy day at work last night, when I discovered she'd nicked into the shops on the way home, picked up some Leffe (one [Brune](http://www.silrubin.com/leffe_brown.htm), one [Blond](http://www.silrubin.com/leffe_blond.htm)), a Kronenburg Blanc &amp; an Erdinger, and they'd been in the fridge long enough to be cold by the time I got home.

Not that this was the reason for putting me in a crappy mood from the morning, but it about sums yesterday up.  We'd been running really low on coffee, but there were a couple of sachets in there (from somebody's last hotel stay, perhaps?), so I decided to use one of them up instead.  Only to find out it was <em>decaffeinated</em> coffee.  What kind of a low, evil trick is that?!?  Cutting work's coffee supply with decaf?!? :-)

Dan Brown's first -- [Digital Fortress](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0552151696/mathieoftheen-21).  At least it's added 34mm to my total for the year.  Actually, if you ignore the fact that he knows nothing more than buzzwords about crypto, it's quite a gripping read.  I suspect this is consistent with his book: he knows sod all about his subject matter, but writes good thrillers.  Hence the Da Vinci Code...</p>

<p><img src="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/0743231511.02.__SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" alt="Book Cover" class="alignright" /> I decided my head deserved some more nurishment after that.  Though given the slightly low mood I've been in the past couple of days, Douglas Coupland's [Life After God](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743231511/mathieoftheen-21) was a poor choice.  It's an excellent book, very introspective, with little snippets of my life written right into it.  And another 22mm.  Who says size matters? :)  That's 753mm total, only another 1117mm to go...</p>

I really need to add some more Coupland to my collection.  I've only got [Life After God](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743231511/mathieoftheen-21) and [Hey Nostradamus!](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0007162510/mathieoftheen-21) -- the rest I've borrowed from friends at one time or another.  In particular I'd like to re-read the post-apocalyptic one I can't recall the name of just now...
