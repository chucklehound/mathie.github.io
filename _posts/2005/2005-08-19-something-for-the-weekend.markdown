OK, so it's going to be a packed and fun-filled weekend already:

* Annabel's mum is here for the weekend, so I'm sure we'll be going to see a few [fringe](http://www.edfringe.com/) shows.
* We've got a food tasting with Saltire, the caterers for the wedding.
* We're going to see another florist about wedding flowers.

But I'd like to get a few geeky things done too:

* Finish transferring static content from my old site.  I've done the [about](http://woss.name/about/) pages (apart from my CV, but that's not currently a priority :-p ).  The only other 'static' page from there would be the comment posting policy.  The rest (pages on body art, reviews of pubs, restaurants, concerts & holidays, recipes and software ideas) can all be backdated blog posts.
* Add a contact details page, including how to find our new house with Google Maps pointing to it and everything.  We don't get nearly enough visitors, so Internet Stalkers are more than welcome. :-)
* Move the modified theme into its own folder and import into Subversion.  Then start modifying it a little more heavily.
* Upgrade my WP installation to 1.5.2
* Finish fiddling with the photographs I've taken recently and upload some of them.
* Write and post the (currently) six drafts I have lying around.  If I have an idea of something I want to write about, I title it, stick in some notes and save it as a draft so I can come back later and fill it in (like when I'm not supposed to be working or paying attention to Annabel!).  The drafts seem to be piling up...
