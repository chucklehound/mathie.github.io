<p><a href="http://woss.name/wp-content/leffe_radieuse.jpg"><img src='http://woss.name/wp-content/thumb-leffe_radieuse.jpg' alt='Leffe Radieuse with glass'  class="alignright" /></a> As an addendum to the previous post, I've selected the shot I'm most happy with.  I had to give up taking pictures when both Saffy and Tiko decided to investigate my 'tableaux', Saffy batting the white sheet (actually a towel...) from underneath the stool, Tiko threatening to pounce on it from the desk!  Click on the image for a larger version.</p>

It's taken with my new 105mm macro lens, at a distance of about 2 metres.  It's taken at f/4.0, 1/60 s, ISO 100.  Originally I'd been using the macro lens -- since it goes down to f/2.8 -- to take the picture without a flash, but to me the versions with flash (fired at a 60&deg; angle) look better.  One interesting thing was that the direction of the flash <em>totally</em> changed the shape of the glass -- which is obvious, if you think about it I suppose.  The only thing I did software-wise was to adjust the white balance, straighten and crop, all in Camera Raw.

One major thing I'd like to have improved upon is taking the flash away from the top of the camera, moving it away to another angle, as I suspect that's what is causing the glint obscuring the picture on the glass.  The detail is mostly still there in the original image, so I'll have to get Annabel to demonstrate her l33t Photoshop skills to fix it.  I've never learned how layer masks work and I guess that's what I'm looking for to adjust just that small part of the image.
