The Guardian Online have an article on the [Top 20 geek novels](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2005/11/09/top_20_geek_novels_the_results.html), surveying the best of the 'geek' novels written in English since 1932.  The results are as follows, with the ones I have read highlighted in bold:

* **The HitchHiker's Guide to the Galaxy -- Douglas Adams**
* **Nineteen Eighty-Four -- George Orwell**
* Brave New World -- Aldous Huxley
* **Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? -- Philip Dick**
* **Neuromancer -- William Gibson**
* Dune -- Frank Herbert
* **I, Robot -- Isaac Asimov**
* **Foundation -- Isaac Asimov**
* **The Colour of Magic -- Terry Pratchett**
* **Microserfs -- Douglas Coupland**
* **Snow Crash -- Neal Stephenson**
* Watchmen -- Alan Moore & Dave Gibbons
* **Cryptonomicon -- Neal Stephenson**
* Consider Phlebas -- Iain M Banks
* **Stranger in a Strange Land -- Robert Heinlein**
* The Man in the High Castle -- Philip K Dick
* **American Gods -- Neil Gaiman**
* **The Diamond Age -- Neal Stephenson**
* The Illuminatus! Trilogy -- Robert Shea & Robert Anton Wilson
* Trouble with Lichen - John Wyndham

I did try reading The Illuminatus! Trilogy -- really, I did.  But it's just, well, in my humble opinion, unreadable.  Completely deranged, switching from one scene (or narrative) to another with nary a paragraph break.  OK, perhaps I should give it another chance sometime, that maybe reading it while I was commuting regularly between Edinburgh and Milton Keynes wasn't the best time to try.  But I'd have to be really desperate to consider it!  I really should get around to trying some of Iain Bank's sci-fi stuff sometime.  I've read most of his other novels, but the only Iain <em>M</em> Banks novel I've ever read is State of the Art.
