This is what I have in the way of photography kit just now:

* [Canon EOS 350D](http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/eos_350d/index.asp) (aka Digital Rebel XT) digital SLR camera.
* Canon [EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 USM](http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/ef_lenses/zoom_lenses/ef-s_18-55mm_f-3.5-5.6/index.asp) lens (ie the default one that comes with the EOS 350D consumer kit).
* Canon [EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM](http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/ef_lenses/zoom_lenses/ef_75300mm_f456iii_usm/index.asp) lens.
* Canon [Speedlite 420EX](http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=141&modelid=7394) flash.
* A couple of Sandisk 512MB compact flash cards, one of which is [dog slow](http://www.sandisk.com/retail/cf.asp); the other is just a [bit slow](http://www.sandisk.com/retail/ultra2-cf.asp).
* A velbon mini tripod
* Jessops-own floor-standing tripod, which maxes out at about 5 feet high.
* A circular polarising filter.
* Spare batteries.
* A bag to put it all in!

That's about it for now...  At some point in the not too distant future, I'd like to add a 50mm f/1.8 lens to that arsenal for lower light/portrait work, and some more (faster!) compact flash cards so I can take more than 130 shots between refills.  Oh, and a macro lens of some variety would rock somewhat. :)

Software-wise, I'm kinda up in the air just now.  That's the post I was about to write, but I figured I should start this category properly, by mentioning what kit I'm using.  So maybe the next post will be more about the software...
