OK, I've already linked to it on [my del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/mathie), but I think this deserves a proper post.  [MailTags](http://www.indev.ca/MailTags.html) is a plugin for Mac OS X 10.4's Mail.app which allows you to add extra metadata to messages.  I can tag messages with a project, a priority, a due date and add extra comments.  It's like being able to stick post-it notes to your email!  I leave everything that I've still to deal with in my Inbox (not the [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gtd) way, but I haven't read the book anyway!), but it gets no further information than <q>ooh, look, you still have to do something about me!</q>  So now I can.  All the messages that are still in my inbox (only 20 of them since I just cleaned it out at the same time) now have an action, a project they're related to and a due date.  Some even have a priority.

But that's not all.  OK, so everything in my inbox has been tagged.  So, how does one make use of these tags?  Simple.  Smart Mailboxes.  I've created a smart mailbox called 'MailManager UI work' which contains all the messages tagged with the 'MailManager UI' project.  It's just an added bonus for searching through all the piles of email I have archived away, trying to find the relevant bit of information.  I want messages about our wedding who's next action is due in less than 2 days?  Got a smart mailbox for that too.

It's going to take a while to populate these smart mailboxes, since most of the existing 9,942 messages in my 'archive' mailbox don't have this meta data, but I think MailTags is going to become the next [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/) in my Mac OS X lifestyle.
