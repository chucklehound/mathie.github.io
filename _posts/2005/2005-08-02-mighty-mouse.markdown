I really want a [new mouse](http://www.apple.com/mightymouse/)!  Finally, Apple have designed a mouse with a scroll wheel and accepted that -- despite their snazzy user interface 'not needing it' -- I <em>want</em> more than one mouse button.  But they've gone one better: it's not just a scroll wheel that allows you to move pages in one dimension, but a scroll ball to move them in two dimensions.  Ideal for quickly zipping around photos that are too large for the screen.  I've always wanted to be able to scroll horizontally from the mouse easily -- most often with awkward web pages that are forced wider than your browser window.

I have a strong temptation to nip up to our local Apple Store after work today.  Or send Annabel in there on her way home.  Or should I just order it from the [Apple Store](http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/ukstore)?  Or should I try and make a 'business case' for it over the course of the afternoon? :-)  (AKA "bug my colleagues 'til they all want one!")
