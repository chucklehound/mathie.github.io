*phew* Finally I've managed to implement online RSVP in our wedding web site.  I've simplified it from my original idea, but it should work OK.  So go try it out, and [RSVP online](http://wedding.mathieson.name/).  (Note, you'll only be able to actually RSVP if you're on the guest list in the first place.  Well, hopefully! :-) )  There's also mention of a couple of mailing lists on the [main page](http://wedding.mathieson.name/), along with various other random details.  I'm sure we'll add to it over the next few weeks.
