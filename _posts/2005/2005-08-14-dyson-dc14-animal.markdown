In the new house, we have <strong>four</strong> cats.  There's always cat hair (and little bits of cat litter!) everywhere.  And in the living room, we have a lovely, squishy, deep pile carpet, which never likes to relinquish the cat hair.</p>

Enter the DC-14 Animal.  It rocks.  The suction truly is constant and powerful.  It picks up everything -- cat litter, hair (no matter how deeply ingrained), the tissues that Saffy has destroyed and left around the place.  The power cable is still long enough that I can clean the entire house from one socket in the living room.  It actually makes vacuuming the house <em>easy</em>.  The major extra with the 'Animal' variant (which otherwise has all the same features as the 'Allergy' model) is the addition of a 'mini turbine head'.  It's like the rotating brush bit that's on the main cleaner, but it's smaller and is an attachment to the hose, which means you get all the cleaning power of the main vacuum cleaner body, but in a smaller form factor.  It is absolutely fantastic for cleaning sofas an chairs that have become cat-hair-infested.

The major downside to the DC-14 Animal is that it's a bit ... big.  The head of the cleaner is sufficiently tall that it doesn't fit underneath our bed, and doesn't get right up to the skirting board underneath radiators, so we sometimes have to use the attachments more than would be necessary with a slimline cleaner.  It's also very noisy -- you can't carry on a telephone conversation in the same house while it's being used.  OK, so we don't shut doors in the house -- don't want to trap cats in a particular room -- which probably would help, but you get the idea.

All in all, the shiniest new toy I've bought in the past month or so.  And I think I'm getting a bit house proud!
