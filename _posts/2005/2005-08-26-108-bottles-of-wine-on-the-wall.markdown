<p><a href="http://woss.name/wp-content/WineCollection.jpg"><img src='http://woss.name/wp-content/thumb-WineCollection.jpg' alt='Laying down wine for the wedding' class="alignright" /></a> Last week we took delivery of 108 bottles of wine from Annabel's mum.  It's all wine for the reception after our wedding.  Click on the image to see it in more detail.  You'd never think that people could drink that much!  So far (!) we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>30 bottles of sparkling wine for the pre-dinner drinks reception.  We reckon that's not enough.</li>
  <li>24 bottles of Domaine Des Allegrets oak-aged red wine.</li>
  <li>30 bottles of Domaine Des Allegrets regular red wine.</li>
  <li>24 bottles of Domaine Des Allegrets white wine.</li>
</ul>

all with our custom labels.  I'm not sure I'm allowed to open the cases and post a picture of the wine bottle with the finished label -- maybe you'll have to wait 'til December 19th to see that -- since I suspect I'd be tempted to 'test' some of the oak aged red.  It is <em>to die for</em>.  Definitely the most wonderful wine I've ever tasted, at least to my ignorant palette.

Does anybody have any particular tips on laying down wine so that it will survive 'til December?  (Apart from 'a locked cupboard'!)  It's currently sitting in a cupboard in the flat, the only unheated room in the house, since I suspect wine will be happiest with little <em>change</em> in temperature.  I guess we could put it in the shed at the end of the garden, if that would be better?  Certainly cooler as we get to autumn, but it is a bit stuffy in there just now...
