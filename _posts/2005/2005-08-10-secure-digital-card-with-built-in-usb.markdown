<p><img src="http://www.sandisk.com/images/retail_ultra2sdplus.jpg" alt="Sandisk with built in USB port" class="alignright" /> This looks absolutely stunning -- a [Secure Digital Card with Built-In USB](http://www.sandisk.com/retail/ultraii-sdplus.asp).  No need to have an adaptor, or waste your camera's battery downloading images to the laptop.  Now all I need is for them to do a Compact Flash version...  I still want some [Extreme III](http://www.sandisk.com/retail/ext3-cf.asp) CF cards -- 20MB/sec minimum write speed should get me at least 3fps continuously in RAW mode.  Currently I can take about 5 frames at 3fps, then it slows down to catch up with writing.  (I can do 8fps virtually continuously in JPEG mode.)</p>
