In this case, I'd somehow set the size of the 'Go' buttons to something like 150px.  Oops.  This is all part of the redesign of the [MailManager](http://www.logicalware.com/) UI where I'm fixing up the markup and styling everything I possible can with CSS, now including the forms.  I should write up a post about how I'm achieving that, but first I ought to get it right...</p>
