OK, I'm having trouble resisting the urge to click the 'add to basket' button.  It's probably just as well I don't have a credit card with enough of a limit on it, really, eh?  I'm still drooling over the potential of [Aperture](http://www.apple.com/aperture/) and trying to figure out how I can afford the hardware to run it to its full potential.  Aha, I've got it.  Nobody wants to <em>eat</em> at our wedding, really, do they?  Me and the ushers will be fine in jeans and a t-shirt, yeah?  Sorted, that'll cover the cost of a nice new G5 (OK, not quite that one!) all by itself...

**Update**  Hmm, come to think of it, if I knock the second 30" display off (I can always get that later, eh?), it'll just fit onto my [Nationwide](http://www.nationwide.co.uk/) credit card...
