In general it does an excellent job at telling me the scary amounts of money I spend on beer, which does a poor job of convincing me to cut back a bit.  I meticulously record &amp; categorise every purchase (which is made easier by not using cash, instead using plastic wherever possible).  And Quicken tells me my finances are in reasonably good shape -- I'm consistently earning more than I spend, staying within budget in most areas (though if there's ever a month where I spend less then &pound;80 on beer -- the 'budget' -- I'll have to go out for a pint to celebrate!), no more credit card debt (paying off the full balance every month), loans are all being paid off.  So why does my current account look absolutely dreadful this month?  (See graph, click on it for a better image, but note that I've deliberately sawn the axis off the left hand side!)</p>

As you can see, highlighted by the red trend line, my mid-month balance (ie once all the regular payments -- loan repayments, credit card bills, etc -- are sorted out, money is moved to the joint account, that kind of thing) has been deteriorating over the past few months.  It's really difficult to 'see' this in Quicken, particularly if you're buying a house and there's lots of money floating around from various sources to pay for it.  And if you've got money in savings earmarked for wedding expenses.

So how did it happen?  Well, I had some credit card debt.  I had miscalculated a back-payment I was due from a previous employer, spent the money I thought I was going to receive on an interest-free credit card.  Then the money arrived and it didn't quite meet my expectations.  So I was left with ~&pound;400 extra debt to cover.  Oops.  And I have a couple of loans I'm paying off -- &pound;270/month over 2 years which was to sort out some difficulty I got myself into a couple of years ago (last payment comes out on September 3rd, which should ease things!) and a student loan which is trickling down at &pound;90/month.

So what's the problem with this?  Well, debts in Quicken are represented by an account, the same way as credits.  And 'paying off' a debt is simply a transfer between accounts, along with an interest payment.  The transfer itself doesn't appear as an expenditure when you're looking at spending over the course of the month, only the interest charge.  So it falls through the cracks.  So more money is actually coming out of my account than is immediately obvious in Quicken.  Oops.

I guess I just need to keep a more careful eye on things.  At least having (by the end of September) squished all my non-asset-backed debts except the student loan, things should start to crawl back up again...
