We spent last night, in the pub, sorting through Annabel's photographs from her hen weekend with her mum in Barcelona.  In [Aperture](http://www.apple.com/aperture/), naturally.  The import of 280 photos (all shot in RAW) took a few minutes, but once the initial import was done, it was really fast to flick through photos, rejecting or selecting images, grouping them together.  We decided that full screen mode was the was forward for that, using the keyboard shortcuts that I'm gradually learning.

One problem:  I've lost the film strip in full screen mode, and I can't figure out how to get it back again!  The keyboard shortcuts for it aren't changing its display, it doesn't pop up when I push the mouse to the edge of the screen (though a toolbar does pop up if you hit the top of the screen).  Kinda irritating, as I was finding that useful for scrolling through images and stacks while I was playing with it earlier.

Ah, why didn't I think of <em>that</em> last night?  I've just quit the program and restarted it.  Suddenly the filmstrip reappears!  I wonder if perhaps it got confused because I'd switched from a dual-display setup (at work) to just the laptop display (in the pub)?

The loupe.  It's <em>wonderful</em>.  Being able to pick out little details in an image while still looking at the full thing is amazing!  I was never into my film photography enough to have discovered one of these devices before, but it is a concept that has made the transfer into Aperture perfectly.  For me, at any rate.  It's perfect for checking that important details are properly in focus, looking at expressions on people's faces (Margaret is the Queen of Funny Faces when getting her photo taken! :-) ), and examining archetectural detail.  Which, while I was looking at photos of the [Sagrada Familia](http://www.sagradafamilia.org/) was particularly useful!</p>

We've yet to explore most of the features of the workflow (adding keywords, tweaking images, producing something at the other end), but Aperture is making me as <em>excited</em> about the post-production side of photography as getting a [proper dSLR](http://woss.name/2005/08/13/my-photography-kit/) did for shooting pictures in the first place!
