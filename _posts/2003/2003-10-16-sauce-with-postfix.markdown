I spent a little time yesterday morning trying to configure
[SAUCE](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/sauce/) on this machine to
handle some of my domains, alleviating some of the load for the *vast*
volume of spam and mail to non-existant mailboxes.  SAUCE is designed to work
with [Exim](http://www.exim.org/) and, while I gather it is a rather shiny MTA,
I'm perfectly happy with [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/) and have no great
desire to change.

It would appear that the Exim version of /usr/lib/sendmail takes additional
options which allow you to emulate an SMTP connection from a remote host (the
connection appears in the logs as appearing from the remote host and Exim will
base its security checks on that information rather than the fact that it has
actually turned up from SAUCE running on localhost).  So, replacing this with
another MTA which does not have this extension is not going to work.  SAUCE
delegates its relay checking to the real MTA.  If the real MTA thinks the
connection is coming from localhost, you're creating an (albeit very
unfriendly) open relay.  I had started by thinking that the config statement
`local_domain` was the list of domains that it should accept mail
for but as far as I can tell, that is only used to determine if an address
pattern is local.  I'm having more than a little difficulty reading
[TCL](http://www.tcl.tk/) and the commentary on the code is not overly
verbose, so I could be completely wrong.

The solution?  I haven't figured that out yet.  Perhaps the ideal thing would
be to modify Postfix to support the same options as Exim's sendmail driver, but
I suspect that Postfix's architecture is going to get in the way there.  I
suspect that SAUCE's rcpt-policy engine can be used to restrict what it accepts
mail for.  Ideally, I'd like to say "accept mail for this list of addresses
(though still doing your stringent checking); be as bastardly as you like while
you drop the rest".   guess I'm going to have to try and understand TCL a
little better.
