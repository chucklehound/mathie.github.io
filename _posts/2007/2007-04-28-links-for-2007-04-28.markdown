* [Text Snippets: make mongrel cleanup stale pidfiles](http://textsnippets.com/posts/show/931): A patch to mongrel that makes it clean up stale pid files instead of just refusing to start.  Applied on all our production hosts.
* [monit](http://www.tildeslash.com/monit/): Process monitoring, which seems to be particularly useful for automatically restarting dodgy processes.
* [Monit makes Mongrel play nice!](http://www.igvita.com/blog/2006/11/07/monit-makes-mongrel-play-nice/): A monit configuration to keep an eye on mongrel processes.  In my case, I felt it needed a little tweaking, but it's yet another thing to add to my default capistrano deployment.
