* [Schneier on Security: JavaScript Hijacking](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/04/javascript_hija.html): I think I need to read and digest this paper, see what will affect the applications we have in production!
* [Dan Manges - Scope Out ActiveRecord Conditions](http://www.dcmanges.com/blog/21): Yeah, scope_out sounds pretty useful.  I've been doing that sort of thing for a while, but haven't actually codified it up into a plugin, and hadn't thought of extending associations.
