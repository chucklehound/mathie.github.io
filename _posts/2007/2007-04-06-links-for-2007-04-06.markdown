* [OpenLaszlo Project Blog Â» How we deal with browser quirks, with a compendium of IE 7 issues](http://weblog.openlaszlo.org/archives/2007/03/how-we-deal-with-browser-quirks-with-a-compendium-of-ie-7-issues/): Now that's the right way to deal with browser quirks.  Much more readable code because I can (as a non-JS-guru) now figure out why you're doing all that apparently useless code!
* [Mailhook - The easiest way to accept mail in your web apps](http://mailhook.org/): Neat application which acts as an email -> http gateway and supposedly handles all the nasty email parsing for you.  I wonder how complete it is...?
* [Use your own URL as an OpenID](http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/use-your-own-url-as-an-openid): Mwuahaha, now, thanks to this insight, my openid is http://woss.name/ -- not that I've really found a genuine use for OpenID yet...
