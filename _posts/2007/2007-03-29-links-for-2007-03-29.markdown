* [capazon's capazon-0.1.0 Documentation](http://capazon.rubyforge.org/): Extensions to capistrano which allow you to manage EC2 instances all from the comfort of `cap`.  Neat!
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Randompage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Randompage): Brings up a random wikipedia entry when you visit it.  It's been suggested that it would make a great default page in Firefox, but the risk of getting distracted by something new and interesting when I was supposed to be checking my email it too great!
