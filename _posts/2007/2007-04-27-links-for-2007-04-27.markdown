* [Foo Fighters &amp; Nine Inch Nails @ Meadowbank, Edinburgh](http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/event/12003E6EDD713ACE): Yay!  Nine Inch Nails!  My tickets are already booked.  Annabel has just noted that "NIN are the rude ones" (she might just have found 'Closer') so I may have a ticket going spare. :)
