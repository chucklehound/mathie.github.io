<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mathie/384001251/" title="Bride of Frankenstein"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/98/384001251_9042613eb5_m.jpg" alt="Bride of Frankenstein" class="alignright" style="border: solid 1px #000000; float: right;" /></a>My wife, Annabel, was in for a wee operation (a parotidectomy) yesterday and she's just managed to escape the hospital this evening.  The operation was a complete success with no sign of any nasty after-effects (the major risk with a parotidectomy is damage to the facial nerve which gives the appearance of having had a stroke and can be permanent!) and she's now at home, convalescing for the next couple of weeks.<br /></p>

Here's one of the piccies I uploaded to Flickr showing off the cool scar!
