  An original Xbox 360, with one wireless controller and a wired Guitar Hero guitar.
  The bundle price also includes
  [all 29 of these games](/for_sale/xbox-games/deliciouslibrary/) whichmakes it a
  pretty good bargain just to get the games! Essentially, I'm trading the Xbox 360 in
  to raise the cash to upgrade to an Xbox One. :)
