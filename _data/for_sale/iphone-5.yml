  The iPhone 5 is two years old, and has been well cared for, kept in a leather
  case for most of its life. It's still in pretty good condition, with a couple
  of scuffs on the corner. It would make a great device for doing iOS
  development and testing, or as a shiny new phone! See also the
  [iPhone Leather Case](#iphone-5-leather-case) for the case it lived in!
