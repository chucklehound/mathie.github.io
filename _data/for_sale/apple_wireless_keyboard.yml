  Blurb from the Apple store:

  > Use the Apple Wireless Keyboard on your desk, on your lap, or anywhere
  within 30 feet of your Mac or iPad — all because of its built-in Bluetooth
  technology.  Its compact design takes up 24 per cent less space on your
  desktop than full-sized keyboards, so you have extra room to move the
  keyboard around and mouse comfortably beside it. You’ll also feel a
  difference when you type on its low-profile, anodised, aluminium enclosure
  with crisp, responsive keys. Use the function keys for one-touch access to
  a variety of Mac features such as screen brightness, volume, eject,
  play/pause, Mission Control, and Launchpad.

  > The Apple Wireless Keyboard requires just two AA batteries - one less than
  the previous model. And its intelligent power-management system conserves
  battery life. So when you’re not using the keyboard, it powers down
  automatically. The instant you start typing, it turns on again. Use the
  on/off switch when you're away from your computer for a long time.
